# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of programming challenges that were first released once a day
btw Dec. 1st and Dec. 25th 2015, and reprogrammed yearly.
                                                                                                                                        
My solutions to the 2015 puzzles, written in **Groovy**, can be found here, together with the 2016 challenges.
See also [this polyglot repository](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/Advent-Of-Code-Polyglot/tree/master/2015/groovy) were I stored my humble contribution in 2015.
For 2017, **Kotlin** is my weapon of choice to tackle Santa's operational issues.
And in 2018, **Python** at last.
